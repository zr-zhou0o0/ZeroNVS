# Scripts
  - launch_noSDS_camera.py
    - Use diffusion_guidance generate novel views
    - Input: a list of camera pose and images.
    - target poses chosen from pose_all, cond images and cond poses chosen from pose_all
  - launch_noSDS_camera.py
    - Use diffusion_guidance generate novel views
    - Input: random target view list(under dataset coordinate system), cond images and cond poses  
  - launch_compare_random_tg.py
    - Randomly choose an image(here image 000063) in our dataset as the default-pose-image in sds.
    - Run sds with the chosen image.
    - Randomly choose a camera view in the 240 pics generated by sds as a target view.
    - Use the Matrix_nerf_to_dataset(M_n2d) to convert target view pose to dataset coordinate system.
    - Choose the nearest camera view in dataset and generate novel view.
    - Note: still cannot align nerf's coordinate and dataset's coordinate.
    - refer to data/rand_tg_compare_output/6_test_nd_convert_datasetcoord/view_camera_y-x.png for camera convert details
  - launch_compare_cond.py
    - Compare SDS and without SDS. Use cond image and camera pose in Zero123 as condition. 
    - both under nerf coordinate system.
  - view_camera.py
    - camera forward vector visualization
  - test_camera.py
    - get nerf camera pose in threestudio
